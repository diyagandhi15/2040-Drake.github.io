# 2040 Drake
[2048 Drake](https://henry7720.github.io/2048-cupcakes/) is a [2048](https://henry7720.github.io/2048-cupcakes/)-based game that uses almost exactly the same code, yet, uses images of Drake in place of the cupcakes.

**Here's a hint (for making your own):** go to `style/main.css` at line [`436`](style/main.css#L436): notice how there's a `background` property? Enjoy!
